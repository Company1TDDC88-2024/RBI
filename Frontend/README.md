# Basics about the frontend

The frontend is a React application using Typescript and Vite.

Reason for using Vite is its fast optimization compared to a standard react project and HMR, making changes appear directly when saving a file. Ant Design is used for components and styling. Designs and more info about Ant Design can be found [here](https://ant.design/components/overview/).

## Prerequisites

First you need Node.js installed on your system in order to use npm. You can download it from [here](https://nodejs.org/en) if don't have it already. Version v20.17.0 works well. When Node is installed, you can use the commands below.

## Running the project

When running the frontend for the first time, you will need install all dependencies for this react app.

```bash

npm  install

```

There after you can start the react application by running

```bash

npm  start

```
